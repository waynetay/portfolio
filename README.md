## About me

Hello, my name is Wayne Tay, and I am from S1-05. I am a dedicated student pursuing my passion for computer science and programming. I believe that programming and AI will soon shape the future of our lives, serving as invaluable tools to streamline tedious tasks and provide the precision needed to accomplish complex goals. I aspire to make a significant impact on the world by leveraging computer science in my journey.

My interest in programming began when I discovered a block-based game engine named “Scratch” at the age of nine during a CCA trial for robotics. Although I ultimately chose basketball, I continued to nurture my interest in computing and transitioned to Python in mid-June 2022. Through this experience, I realized how computer science and AI can contribute to making the world a better place. This realization has fueled my desire to pursue this passion and use technology to benefit everyone.

# Project

## School Management Project [Github Link](https://github.com/Wayne005/Student-Management-Project)

I made a project that reads CSV files and allows teachers to monitor students grades and see the average grade for each student, the average grade of all students in a course, the average grade of all courses for a student, the grades a student got and the AL or alphabet scoring converter.
